# Handy Dandy AHK Hotstrings!
Simply run this script with AutoHotKey (I have it run when my computer starts up by putting it in the Windows startup folder) and use the hotstrings!

# VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
This script will NOT work if your script file is not encoded in UTF-8 BOM. This is easily done in Notepad++ by clicking on Encoding -> UTF-8 BOM in the toolbar.

# HOTSTRINGS EXAMPLES
Typing `.pi` will delete what you just wrote and replace it with `π` when you press space.

`.dash` -> `—`

`.dot` -> `•`

`.tu` -> `d–(^ ‿ ^ )z`

`.shrug` -> `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

`.wave` -> `( ﾟ◡ﾟ)/`

`.square` -> `²`

`.lambda` -> `λ`

`.section` -> `§`

`.lenny` -> `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`

`.donger` -> `ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ`

`.tm` -> `™`

`.copyright` -> `©`
